ROOT CAUSE: Based on similarity to past ticket incidents and the error pattern, this appears to be a database connection pool exhaustion issue. The symptoms match previous tickets where concurrent user load exceeded the maximum connection pool size, causing timeout errors. The production environment configuration shows a max pool size of 20 connections, which is insufficient for the current user base of 500+ users.

RESOLUTION:

**Immediate Mitigation:**
- Scale up the application pods from 2 to 4 replicas to distribute the load
- Temporarily increase the database connection timeout from 30s to 60s

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Check database connection pool metrics: `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active'`
2. Review application logs for connection timeout errors in the last 2 hours
3. Monitor the connection pool utilization dashboard
4. Verify current pod count: `kubectl get pods -n production`

**Fix Implementation:**
- Update the database connection pool configuration in `application.yml`:
  * Increase `maxPoolSize` from 20 to 50
  * Set `minPoolSize` to 10
  * Configure `connectionTimeout` to 45000ms
- Deploy the configuration change: `kubectl apply -f config-map.yaml`
- Monitor for 15 minutes to ensure stability

**Verification Steps:**
1. Confirm all users can access the application without timeout errors
2. Verify database connection pool metrics show utilization below 80%
3. Check application response times are under 200ms
4. Monitor error rate drops to 0% on the dashboard

**Preventive Measures:**
- Implement auto-scaling rules based on connection pool utilization
- Set up alerts when pool utilization exceeds 70%
- Add connection pool metrics to the observability dashboard
- Schedule a capacity planning review for Q1 to reassess connection pool sizing
